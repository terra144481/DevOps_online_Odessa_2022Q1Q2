<p>I became a member of the EPAM University program in this year. It's great! I'm learning a lot of new technologies. 
<p> I learned the basics knowleges about AWS Cloud: 
<br>- <b>EC2</b> - Virtual Servers in the Cloud;
<br> - <b>Amazon Lightsail</b>;
<br> - <b>IAM</b> - Manage access to AWS resources;
<br> - <b>S3</b> - Scalable Storage in the Cloud;
<br> - <b>ECR</b> - Fully-managed Docker container registry.</p>
